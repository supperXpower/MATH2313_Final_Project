# MATH2313_Final_Project
MATH2313 course final project for Fall 2024 ShanghaiTech


The main folder is "dslc_documentation" that includes "01_cleaning.ipynb" "02_eda.ipynb" "03_prediction.ipynb" that stands for the Exploring and Cleaning section, EDA section and Prediction and PCS section of the project.

A subfolder "function" including "data_clean_and_preprocess.py" "load_diabetes_data.py" "segment.py". They are functions that will be used in the above three documents.

The "data" folder contains "samadult.csv" that's the origin data of survey, a subfolder "data_documentation" contains the details of the variables (columns) of "samadult.csv".

You can run the three ".ipynb" to get a result or use the result printed on these documents. But if you run the code, the result is randomly generated.

If you want to get a fixed result, you can set some random seeds in some of functions.
